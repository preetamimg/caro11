                        <li>Our fantasy gaming services are wholly skill-based activities.</li>
                        <li>Even while they might be used for entertainment and have alluring reward systems, they cannot and must not be compared to a steady source of revenue.</li>
                        <li>You should keep track of how much time and money you spend using our services. If you think it's impacting you personally or financially, we advise you to quit right away. </li>
                        <li>Play with a cheerful attitude and not to make up for previous "losses."</li>
                        <li>Please refrain from asking for money to play these games. </li>
                        <li>Before moving ahead, be sure to consult your family and friends. </li>
                        <li>Additionally, we forbid gamers under the age of 18 from using our services. Please note that you cannot allow any children to play through your <b>Caro11</b> profile if you are an adult. </li>
                        <li> From our end, we proactively monitor users and their activities for identifying vulnerable users and we reach out to them to ensure that they play responsibly. These measures include, but are not limited to, advising a user by email to exercise due caution if the user has lost more than Rs. 25000 in a day, advising a user by calling to exercise due caution if the user has lost more than Rs. 75000 in a week and offer them the option to either opt-out permanently or for a specific timeframe. </li>
                        <li>We advise you to set restrictions on how much time you can freely devote to participating in our online fantasy games. </li>
                        <li>We advise you to use only an amount that you could afford to lose in the worst-case situation and to think very carefully about bank management. </li>

                        <li>Daily Fantasy Sports may be addictive at times and since paid games involve time and monies, please play responsibly at your own risk.</li>

                        <li>As a reasonable person, please refrain from chasing losses. You should not consider compensating previous losses in the new contests/events with an expectation of earning profit. </li>
                        <li>We would recommend you to do proper financial planning and set aside an entertainment budget that does not put any kind of constraints on you. </li>
                        <li>For ensuring proper social, professional, personal and family life, you are advised to keep a track of the time you spend playing rummy and ensure that you do not comprise your daily routine, family time, time for employment or profession, or time for any other commitments.. </li>
                        <li>We would urge you to avoid playing on our platform under the influence of alcohol, other intoxicating substances or heightened emotional stress.
